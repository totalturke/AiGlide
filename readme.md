### Glide Plugin Starter with AI

This is a basic boilerplate for creating Glide plugins. It now includes an option to connect to OpenRouter's free Google model (Gemma 3 27B IT) for AI-generated responses.

## Usage

- **Prompt**: Enter your text prompt.
- **Use OpenRouter AI**: Check this to generate an AI response instead of returning the prompt as-is.
- **OpenRouter API Key**: Provide your OpenRouter API key (get one at https://openrouter.ai/keys).

When AI is enabled, the plugin will use the free Google model to generate a response based on your prompt.
